## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how Azure policy can be used. Specifically, you need to:

- Create an Allowed Locations policy that ensures resource are only created in a specific region.
- Test to ensure resources are only created in the Allowed location

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class.
